# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to examine the original data without the reading and math scores for the ninth graders at Thomas High School. The school board notified our client that the “students_complete.csv” file shows evidence of academic dishonesty. With these scores removed, a more accurate picture of the school district’s math and reading scores will be captured. Once removed we will repeat the analysis previously completed and report back to our client.
